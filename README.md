A simple and concise demonstration on how to use Mocha, Chai, and Karma to unit and integration test the frontend.

# Prereqs #

You must have Node.js installed.

# Get it running #

In the root directory, execute:

```bash
npm install
```

To start/run the tests, execute the following in the root directory:

```bash
node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
```

By default, Karma is configured to watch for changes, so any changes you make to the sample.js or the sampleTest.js will automatically be picked up and tests will be rerun.
